Hi Takato Yamada
I am a MSc student in embedded system. I found a papaer called"Automated flow for compressing convolution neural
networks for efficient edge-computation with FPGA" 2017.
I am very interested in it, but it is just a post which does not have lots of details. would you mind tell me more about it ?


Best Wishes
